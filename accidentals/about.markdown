The Accidentals are an Edinburgh based amateur classical guitar ensemble who meet on a weekly basis in the Tollcross area of town and we rehearse on Monday evenings from 7:15pm 'til 9:15pm. We encourage players of all standards to join us, the only requirement is that you need to be able to read music at least a little.

We play a wide variety of music and a typical concert programme will see us playing a selection of Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and 20th Century music as well as a selection of Spanish and Latin American music.

The Accidentals are lead by Mike McGeary, a professional guitarist and teacher based in Edinburgh.

The Accidentals are a non-profit organisation but in order to cover our costs there is a termly fee of £75 (£37.50 for students) in order to cover room hire, tutor fees and the purchase of music. Please contact us by email if you wish any more information.
